### **Lesson Outline**

#### **Understanding Data**
1. **What is Data?**
   - Definition of data: Data refers to raw facts and figures that can be processed to extract meaningful information. It can be structured (organized in tables) or unstructured (like text or images).
   - Data vs. Information: The transformation of data into meaningful insights. [Data vs Information](https://bloomfire.com/blog/data-vs-information/)
   - Examples of data in everyday life (e.g., weather reports, social media metrics).

2. **Types of Data**
   - Qualitative vs. Quantitative Data.
   - Structured vs. Unstructured Data.
   - Examples:
     - Qualitative: Customer reviews, survey responses.
     - Quantitative: Sales figures, test scores.

3. **Sources of Data**
   - Internal vs. External Sources:
     - Internal: Company databases, employee records.
     - External: Market research, social media analytics.
   - Primary vs. Secondary Data:
     - Primary: Surveys, interviews, experiments.
     - Secondary: Articles, government reports, public datasets.
